# LearningMadeSimple
An e-learning platform with focus on scalability, modularity and openness.

##Purpose
The LearningMadeSimple project was created during an internship at OddHill http://www.oddhill.se/ located in Malm√∂, Sweden

##About the LearningMadeSimple
The platform was built with the use of the framework AngularJS for the client side and NodeJS for the server side.

We used Digitalocean to host the application during the development and later moved it to Heroku for demo purposes.
